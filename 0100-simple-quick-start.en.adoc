== Simple Quick Start Guide

The two quick start guides should introduce most users to the key features needed to adapt datasets for the MDT. Begin with the simple guide, then move to the advanced. 

This simple guide walks users through processing a minimal example dataset with minimal explanation, requiring little to no prior knowledge of eDNA data, GBIF, or Darwin Core

=== Simple example dataset

IMPORTANT: This quick start uses a minimal example dataset with 5 samples, 4 OTUs, and very limited metadata. For real datasets, more extensive metadata is encouraged. This guide is solely to introduce the basics of the MDT. 

NOTE: This example data is basede on template 1 (see <<templates>> section), and is decribed in the <<example_data> section>.

. Download link:../example_data/example_data1.current.en.xlsx[Example Dataset 1].
. Save the file to your computer.
. (Optional) Explore the structure of the example data in e.g. Microsoft Excel.
* The Excel workbook has four sheets: *OTU_table*, *Taxonomy*, *Samples* and *Study*.
**  *OTU_table* is the OTU table, with sample IDs as column headers, OTU IDs as row names, and sequence read counts in the cells.
** *Taxonomy* links OTU IDs (from OTU_table) to sequence and taxonomic info.
** *Samples* links sample IDs (from OTU_table) to sample metadata: e.g. spatiotemporal information, protocols etc.
** *Study* holds global values for the dataset, such as barcoding region, primer sequences, and primer names.

=== Log in

. Go to https://edna-tool.gbif-uat.org/[the MDT^].
. Log in
+
NOTE: If you do not have an account, the login prompt will link you to the sign-up form.

. Press *New Dataset* in the upper part of the page.
+
This opens the first step of the data processing.


=== Upload data (step 1)

image::img/process_step_1.png[]

. Drag the example dataset to the upload area, OR click and select the file on your computer.
. Give the dataset a nickname (e.g. "my_first_test")
. Press *Start Upload*.
+
A green icon will indicate that the data looks OK.
. Press *Proceed*

=== Map terms (step 2)

On this page, you specify the mapping of the fields in the uploaded data, indicating how the fields correspond to Darwin Core terms.

NOTE: Since this test dataset already utilizes Darwin Core terms as field names, no manual mapping is required.  

TIP: Press *how to use this form* to get a guided tour of this page.

The first section concerns the mapping of sample data fields to Darwin Core terms (first column). The MDT has automatically mapped four fields from the *Samples* sheet (second column) and five fields from the *Study* sheet (third column) to their identically named Darwin Core counterparts: e.g. the field with sampling dates is called _eventDate_ in the uploaded data corresponding exactly to the Darwin Core term term:dwc[eventDate], and the field _pcr_primer_forward_ corresponds to the term term:dwc[pcr_primer_forward]).

The second section concerns the mapping of taxonomy and sequence related information. The MDT has automatically mapped four fields from the *Taxonomy* sheet to identically named Darwin Core terms.

. Press *Proceed* to save the mapping and proceed.

=== Process data (step 3)

NOTE: The option *assign taxonomy* uses the https://www.gbif.org/tools/sequence-id[GBIF Sequence ID tool^] to assign taxonomy to the sequences. This overwrites any taxonomy provided in the data. We will not use that option here.

. Press *Process data*.

This produces standardized intermediate files in the BIOM format, and some basic stats/metrics on the dataset, e.g. number of samples, etc.

[start=2]
. Press *Proceed*

=== Review (step 4)

Here the processed data is explored to check that everything is OK, e.g. ensure control samples are not included as samples, and that the mapping is as expected.


. (_Optional_) Check the data.
** Check the map and verify that the samples are placed geographically where expected (Northern part on Denmark). 
** Check the taxonomic barchart to ensure that taxonomic composition is as expected.
** Check ordination plots (PCoA/MDS) for outliers (e.g. control samples that were not excluded).
** Select single samples from the map or chart and explore their metadata and taxonomy in the panel to the right.
. Press *Proceed*

=== Add metadata (step 5)

On this page, you provide dataset metadata. Certain mandatory fields must be completed in order to proceed. Here we ignore most of this.

. Add a meaningful title (e.g. “my first test dataset”).
. Select a licence.
. Add contact information - minimum: email and ORCID.
+
NOTE: use e.g. 1111-2222-3333-123X as dummy ORCID if you wish.
. Leave the other fields empty.
. Press *Proceed*.

=== Export (step 6)

At this step, the so-called <<dwc-a>> is produced. It can be published directly to the GBIF test environment (UAT) from the MDT.

. Press *Create DWC archive*.
+
This process generates the Darwin Core Archive from the data, progressing through several steps, each marked with a green check if successful.

. Press *Publish to GBIF test environment (UAT)*.

A notification will indicate that data ingestion may take a few minutes before all samples appear in the GBIF test environment. A link to the dataset in the test environment will appear next to the Publish button.

[start=3]
. Click on your username in the top right. Here you can:
** see your datasets,
** access them on the test environment (UAT), and
** modify and export/publish updated/new versions.

You should now have a first [.underline]#basic# idea of how the MDT works and how you may adapt a real datasets. It is highly recommended go through the <<advanced_quick_start>> also.
